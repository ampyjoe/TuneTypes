Wandering far from the only home I’ve known.

Come, little one, it won’t be much longer now.
Soon we will rise to the heavens as one, Silvery threads in the light of the sun,
Knowing when to hold on and when to just let go.

An the juices of the pomegranate pressed on me By Hades of the underneath
Will run like scarlet down my chin. Although I rise each spring, I know I can never win.

With your treasures and morsels divine.
I can be anything I want, like mist on a mountainside.
Or a boulder that’s buried deep, determined to shelter my pride.
Give me everything you’ve got, I will twist and I will run.
This is one thing you will not have, 
For I promise this time I will not be overcome.
